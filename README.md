# Hospital-Wait-Time-Project-By-Lean-Six-sigma-Green-Belt

This project focuses on reducing excessive patient wait times in key hospital service areas by applying Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC) methodology. Long wait times negatively impact patient satisfaction, staff efficiency, and overall quality of care. The goal of this project is to analyze current patient flow processes, identify root causes of delays, and implement sustainable improvements that reduce non–value-added time while maintaining patient safety and clinical quality.
The project begins by defining the scope, objectives, and customer requirements related to acceptable wait times. Baseline data on patient wait times will be collected and analyzed to identify bottlenecks, variation, and inefficiencies within the existing processes. Tools such as process mapping, root cause analysis, and data analysis will be used to understand contributing factors including staffing patterns, scheduling practices, workflow design, and communication gaps.
Based on the analysis, targeted improvement solutions will be developed and tested to streamline patient flow, standardize processes, and eliminate waste. These may include workflow redesign, better resource allocation, improved scheduling, and standardized work practices. The effectiveness of implemented solutions will be measured against baseline performance.
Finally, control measures such as standard operating procedures, performance dashboards, and ongoing monitoring will be established to ensure improvements are sustained over time. The successful completion of this project is expected to reduce patient wait times, improve patient satisfaction, enhance staff productivity, and support a culture of continuous improvement within the hospital.
